# rust-json-benchmark
This project is a simple JSON benchmark with Rust and Serde.

# Quick Start

First off you need to set the path for `news.json` and `keywords.json` files. you can put some autogenerated content in those files.

Then you should change the path to these files in `main.rs` files.

```rust
    let mut file = File::open("/PATH_TO/keywords.json").unwrap();
```

```rust
    let mut file = File::open("/PATH_TO/news.json").unwrap();
```

After that you can run with:

```shell
cargo run --release
```
Note: You need Rust build tools to be installed on your system.
